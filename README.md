# Welcome to my page!

My name is Júlia Ortís Sunyer and, even though I have been living in Sweden for a couple of years, I am from a small town near Barcelona. Currently, I am a master student at the [Bioinformatics MSc program at Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lubas/i-uoh-lu-NABIF).

## Background

I studied Biology at the [University of Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/web/portal/en/), where I obtained my Bachelor of Science with a major in Biology and a minor in Molecular, Cellular and Systems Biology. After graduating, I enrolled in a [master's program in Molecular Biology - Microbiology at Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lubas/i-uoh-lu-NAMOB-MIBI), which I completed in 2020.

As you can see, my background is on molecular biology rather than bioinformatics. However, I feel it is an important skill to have that complements well the laboratory skills I gained during my previous master´s.

## Projects

- Summer Intern - Lund University, Lund, Sweden
  Internship in Stefan Schwartz laboratory during the Summer. It was the continuation of my master thesis. The main techniques used were plasmid construction, cloning into E. coli, transfection into HeLa cells, RNA and protein extraction, PCR and Western blot.

- Master Thesis Project - Lund Unviersity, Lund, Sweden
  My master thesis was titled "Determining the effects of ribonucleoprotein hnRNP D40 on the alternative splicing of HPV-16 E6/E7 and E1/E2 and identifying hnRNP D40’s nuclear export pathway." It was performed under Dr. Stefan Schwartz supervision. The techniques used were plasmid construction, cloning into E. coli, transfection of the plasmid into HeLa cells, RNA and protein extraction, PCR and Western blot.

- Bachelor Thesis Project - Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalunya, Spain
  My bachelor thesis was titled “Response of the musculoskeletal system to fasting and refeeding in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata).” It was performed under the supervision of Dr. Joaquim Gutiérrez at the department of cellular biology, physiology and immunology. My job consisted on studying the gene and protein changes during fasting and refeeding on gilthead seabream by using RNA and protein extraction, PCR and Western blot.

- Summer Intern - Yonsei University, Wonju-si, South Korea
  I was awarded a place in the international exchange program from IFMSA. This program allows the student to do a biomedical internship in a foreign country. The internship consisted of working alongside a PhD student studying the role of mitochondria in diabetes and diabetic complications.
