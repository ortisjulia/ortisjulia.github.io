# Welcome to my page!

My name is Júlia Ortís Sunyer and even though I have been living in Sweden for a couple of years, I am from a small town near Barcelona. Currently, I am a master student at the [Bioinformatics MSc program at Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lubas/i-uoh-lu-NABIF).

## Background

I studied Biology at the [University of Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/web/portal/en/), where I obtained my Bachelor of Science with a major in Biology and a minor in Molecular, Cellular and Systems Biology. After graduating, I enrolled in a [master's program in Molecular Biology - Microbiology at Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lubas/i-uoh-lu-NAMOB-MIBI), which I completed in 2020.

As you can see, my background is on molecular biology rather than bioinformatics. However, I feel it is an important skill to have that complements well the laboratory skills I gained during my previous master´s.
